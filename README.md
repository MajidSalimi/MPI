# MPI
Projects written with MPI in Parallel.

Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing standard designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures. The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in C, C++, and Fortran.
MPI is a communication protocol for programming parallel computers. Both point-to-point and collective communication are supported. MPI "is a message-passing application programmer interface, together with protocol and semantic specifications for how its features must behave in any implementation."MPI's goals are high performance, scalability, and portability. MPI remains the dominant model used in high-performance computing today.

Before using mpi, you should install MPICH package.

Install MPICH on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install mpich

Then You can compile and run your parallel codes.
